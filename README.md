## To use

There are several simple server implementations included. They all serve static files from `public/` and handle requests to `comments.json` to fetch or add data. Start a server with one of the following:

### Node

```sh
npm install
node server.js
```

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>. Try opening multiple tabs!
